#Employee Salaries for different job roles
#firstly, install ISLR Package

#inorder to extract the data use the following codes:-

#Making a regression model in EXPONENTIAL FORM
#x-variable- salary, y-variable-remote ratio
#Remote Ratio-The percentage of remote work allowed for the position.
plot(employee_salaries$remote_ratio~employee_salaries$salary, xlab="salary of the employees", ylab="remote ratio")
reg<-lm(remote_ratio~salary,data=employee_salaries)

#Intuition:- As the salary increases by 1 currency, the estimated remote ratio decreases by 3.85 percent on an average.
# This shows that as people goes to higher position, they are allowed to work from office rather than from their respective convinient places.

#Plotting the graph in LOGARITHMIC FORM
salary<-log(employee_salaries$salary)
